Project 2a: The Unix Shell
Emulate a unix shell with fork(), exec(), and wait().


Project 2b: xv6 Scheduler
Refactor the scheduler to use a multi-level feedback queue with lottery ticket 
based process selection.

2b Graph:
We can see that as time progresses, the CPU allotment (in terms of time slices)
approaches the ticket share. We expect this result because in statistics, the
law of large numbers tells us that as the number of experiments grows
infinitely large, the results will get closer & closer to the expected values.
